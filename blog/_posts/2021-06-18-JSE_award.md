# Paper wins award

Our paper "Phylogenomic delineation of  *Physcomitrium*  (Bryophyta: Funariaceae) based on targeted sequencing of nuclear exons and their flanking regions." has won the **2019 Outstanding Papers by Young Investigators Award** by the *Journal of Systematics and Evolution*! The paper, which uses a phylogeny of over 600 nuclear loci to identify relationships within *Physcomitrium* and *Entosthodon*, was led by [Rafael Medina](http://www.rafamedina.com/). One of the key findings of the paper was that single-taxon genera with reduced sporophytes, like *Physcomitrella*, *Physcomitridium*, and *Aphannoregma* are embedded within *Physcomitrium* representing parallel evolution. The rejection of the reduced-sporophyte genera results in a reclasification of the model moss, *P. patens*, which is now *Physcomitrium patens*  

[The JSE Young Investigators Award](https://www.jse.ac.cn/EN/abstract/abstract71645.shtml) is given to outstanding papers from first authors who received their Ph.D. degree within 7 years and includes a cash award. The authors have decided to donate the prize to the International Association of Bryologists to support student research awards.
