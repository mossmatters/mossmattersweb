# Yanni Chen Wins Native Plant Society Grant

We are pleased to announce that Ph.D. Candidate Yanni Chen has received a research grant from the Native Plant Society of Texas, for her project titled: **"Ecoregion Variation Impacts on Gene Expression Associated with Smoke-induced Germination in *Bouteloua gracilis*, Shortgrass Prairie Native Species"** 


*Bouteloua gracilis* (blue gramma) is a grass native to Texas and plays an important role in cattle grazing, landscape construction, and shortgrass prairie restoration. Smoke, as a low cost efficient seed dormancy breaking treatment, has proven its effectiveness on *B. gracilis*. However, the seed source of *B. 
gracilis* population variation may influence smoke effectiveness, especially if genes showing smoke response in model organisms do not show the same response  in native species. Yanni proposed using RT-qPCR to examine variation in primary smoke receptor genes across populations on shortgrass prairie native species, 
*Bouteloua gracilis*. The study will verify whether the seed source of *B. gracilis* will influence smoke induced germination effects, while also enhancing our broader understanding of smoke-induced seed germination.

For the project, Yanni will collect seeds of blue gramma grass across the precipitation gradient in Texas and test them for variation in smoke-induced seed germination. Yanni will then test for variation in gene expression in *KAI2* and other genes identified as involved in smoke sensing in model organisms, using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). 

Congratulations to Yanni!
