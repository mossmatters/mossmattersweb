# Post-Doctoral Research Position

The Johnson Lab at Texas Tech University (Lubbock, Texas) is looking for a postdoctoral scholar to develop novel bioinformatics methods that extend targeted DNA sequencing in plants for used on mixed and unknown samples. This two-year full-time position is funded by a Broad Agency Agreement from the United States Food and Drug Association Center for Food Safety and Nutrition (FDA-CFSAN). The successful candidate will work with Dr. Matt Johnson (Assistant Professor, TTU Department of Biological Sciences) to write open-source bioinformatics software â€“ specifically, new methods that leverage Angiosperms353 data to extend the potential of metagenomics in plants and in collaboration with Dr. Sara Handy (FDA-CFSAN). You can find more information about the project here.

Applicants should have a PhD in biology (botany, evolution, genetics), computer science (bioinformatics, data science, software development) or a related field, with the degree completed before starting the postdoc position. Ideal candidates will have experience working with DNA sequence data in one or more programming languages (Python, C++, R, Java, etc) demonstrated through scientific publication and/or published code (e.g. GitHub). Preferred candidates will have strong written and oral communication skills and will have demonstrated ability to work both independently and as part of a research team.

The successful candidate will be expected to:

1. generate a database of high-throughput targeted DNA sequencing data from plants 
2. develop novel computational methods for the identification of plants using targeted DNA sequences from mixed collections 
3. mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the development of bioinformatics skills
4. publish peer-reviewed manuscripts and present research results at national scientific conferences.  

The Johnson Lab is dedicated to creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for generating high quality science, and the successful candidate is expected to share this commitment. Candidates from groups historically excluded in biological and computer science research are especially encouraged to apply. Review of applications will begin October 15, 2022 and will continue until the position is filled. Start date is flexible but can begin as soon as January 2023.

## How To Apply

Applications should be made directly on the TTU website by following this link.


**All candidates should also e-mail me (matt.johnson@ttu.edu) to confirm their application.**


## Requirements
- Curriculum Vitae
- Names and contact information for 3 references
- Statement of interest (no more than two pages) describing:
 - Your experience high-throughput DNA sequencing
 - Your skills in bioinformatics and computer programming 
 - Your commitment to working in a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment


## Compensation

This position will follow the NIH fellowship and training guidelines for post-doctoral researchers, commensurate with candidate experience.
