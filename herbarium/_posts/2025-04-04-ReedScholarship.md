# Madison Bullock Wins First E.L. Reed Scholarship!

We are proud to announce the first recipient of the E.L. Reed Herbarium Legacy Endowment Scholarship, Madison Bullock!

The E.L. Reed Herbarium Legacy Endowment was established in 2024 by grandchildren of E.L. Reed, the first botanist at Texas Tech (then Texas Technological College). The Endowment funds a scholarship for graduate students who contribute to or make use of the herbarium collection that bears E.L. Reed's name. The scholarship is awarded by the Texas Tech Department of Biological Sciences graduate student awards committee. 

[Madison Bullock]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link team/_posts/2021-09-01-madison-bullock.md %}) is a PhD candidate in the Johnson Lab at Texas Tech University. Her research uses herbarium specimens to study the impacts of land use and climate change in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park (GUMO). Specifically, Madison uses 50-year-old specimens to ask question about the genetic diversity of endemic and common species in GUMO and the past water use efficiency of plants in the high elevation desert envivronment.  Madison has also contributed hundreds of new specimens to the E.L. Reed Herbarium during extensive field work she has led at GUMO. 

Congratulations, Madison!
