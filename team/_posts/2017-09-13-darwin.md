Darwin was an 18 year old domestic long hair and one of the unofficial lab mascots. He is responsible for making sure all of the collection materials have been thoroughly inspected for illicit catnip. Darwin was named after the [dolphin from SeaQuest DSV](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/why-seaquest-dsv-is-the-ultimate-90s-sci-fi-show). We lost Darwin in October, 2024, and he continues to fetch hair ties in all of our hearts.
