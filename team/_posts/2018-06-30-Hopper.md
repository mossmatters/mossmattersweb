Hopper is a 5 year old Cardigan Corgi and one of the unofficial lab mascots. Hopper has many research interests including chasing balls, finding rats in "[Barn Hunt](barnhunt.com/index.html)," running a 100 yard dash in 11 seconds, and splooting.

Hopper is named after [Admiral Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper), the US Navy scientist who invented the first machine independent computer programming languages.
