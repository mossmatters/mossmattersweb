*Aman graduated with his Master's in Biology in May 2022 and now works in industry*

Hey, this is Aman Pruthi, a masters student in Biological Sciences at Texas Tech University under Dr. Johnson. I'm interested to know about the nature of Bryophyte (Moss) genomes, especially how they contribute insight to the evolution of small RNA in plants.

I have done my undergraduate in Biotechnology from Punjab Agricultural Univeristy, India. I am curious to know more and more about plants and how they can aid the human population in any number of ways one can imagine.

I'm a fitness freak and I love swimming and cricket. So you can find me working out when I'm not available in the lab.
