Hi, my name is Madison, and I started my Ph.D. program in Biological Sciences at
Texas Tech University under Dr. Matt Johnson in the Fall of 2021. Growing up, my
father had a farm in northwest Missouri, so I was constantly surrounded by nature.
I fell in love with the outdoors and learning all I could about wildlife and plants.

I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia where I
worked as an undergraduate research assistant under Dr. Gary Johnson. This was
where I first became interested in genetics and considered pursuing it as a career
path. I continued in a master’s program at San Francisco State University under
Dr. Jason T. Cantley. My thesis on “Exploring evolutionary adaptations of leaf
heteroblasty in subspecific taxa of Hawaiian Chenopodium oahuense” investigated
a recently-described, endangered Chenopodium taxon, further defining its
subspecies as well as documenting its heteroblastic leaf changes from juvenile to
adulthood. At this time, I also became interested in bioinformatics and
morphometrics, primarily in R.

At Texas Tech, my research broadly focuses on the advancement of techniques,
methods, and tools for the utilization of herbarium specimen uses in plant
conservation. My projects include a comparison of genetic diversity and population
structure of Guadalupe Mountains endemic plants to their widespread congeners,
a natural history of the effects of global change on plants in the Guadalupe
Mountains over 100 years, a taxonomic resolution of North American Philadelphus
taxa, and the creation of models to identify areas of high plant phylogenetic
diversity in Texas using targeted sequences. To help address these topics, I also
develop methods to increase the cost effectiveness and bioinformatic
informativeness of targeted sequencing. I intend for these methods to benefit plant
conservation through increasing access to scientific resources when financial
resources are limited. In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my family,
spending time in my garden, and hiking (mostly to look at the plants).
