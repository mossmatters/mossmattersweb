James joined the lab in fall 2021 and has been working hard at keeping our moss cultures alive! 

James is also working on the Physcomitrium project, to identify whether cryptic species exist within *Physcomitrium pyriforme* in Eastern North America. We hope to begin crossing experiments to test for reproductive isolation soon, and James has been learning DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis to test for hybrids.

James graduated *cum laude* from TTU in May 2023 and is currently pursuing medical school.
