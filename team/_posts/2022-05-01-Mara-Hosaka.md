Mara has been working in the lab and herbarium since Fall 2022. She has worked extensively on the Guadalupe Mountains National Park (GUMO) collection, helping to mount specimens and enter them into our database. Mara joined us on our first return collecting trip to GUMO in May 2022. She is currently working on a masters thesis project to identify changes in the fungal microbiome associated with plants at GUMO between the 1970s and 2020s.
