Hello! I am a senior pre-med Biology and Spanish double-major here at TTU in the Honors College. I first joined the Johnson lab in Spring of 2022 uploading photos of herbarium specimens to the Torch website. I am currently working as an Honors Undergraduate Research Scholar with the Angiosperms 353 project. I will be working with Unix and Hybpiper to add DNA sequences to the phylogenetic tree of West Texas.

Some activities I enjoy in my free time are playing guitar, reading, and keeping up with the latest anime episodes. After graduating from TTU, I plan to apply to medical school to become a pediatrician.
