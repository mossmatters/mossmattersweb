Hello, my name is William and I am currently an undergraduate (Senior) at Texas Tech University. My major is Biology, specifically in the field of Pre-Medicine; my minor is in Chemistry. Within this lab research, I am working in the field of Phytomedicine—which is botanical specimen that can be used as medicinal products to combat human diseases and/or illnesses. 

I am looking into the literature aspect of this discipline to bring more attention and knowledge about this field within the medical realm.I had begun working under Dr. Matt Johnson’s lab as of August 2022 and looking forward to knowing more about Phytomedicine, especially working with the E.L REED herbarium as a source of information for this topic.

*Will graduated in August 2023 with sights set on medical school.
