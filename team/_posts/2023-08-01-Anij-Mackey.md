Anij Mackey joined the lab in summer 2022, working on macrophotography of the bryophyte herbarium collection. In Fall 2023, Anij began working on the *Physcomitrium pyriforme* project, investigating reproductive isolation among distinct clades within the species. Anij maintains cultures of *P. pyriforme* in or growth chambers and is working on a crossing experiment to determine reproductive compatibility among clades.
