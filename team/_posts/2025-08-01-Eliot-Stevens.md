Elle joined our team in summer 2025 and worked on analyzing data generated through our miniaturized library prep for target capture sequencing. Elle compared libraries generated with half volumes to those generated with tenth volumes to see if there was a difference in plastid gene recovery. 

Elle is a math major and intends to pursue a PhD in mathematical biology.
