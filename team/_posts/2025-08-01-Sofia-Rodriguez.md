Sofia has worked in the lab since Spring 2024, and has assisted us on field work on three trips to GUMO. In Fall 2025, Sofia began working on our *Abronia* research project, focusing on building maps to associate genetic diveristy with ecological variables. 

Sofia is interested in the interface of conservation science and public policy, and plans to pursue a PhD in plant genetics.
